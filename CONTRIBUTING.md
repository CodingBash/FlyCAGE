# Contribute to FlyCAGE
Thank you for considering to contribute to FlyCAGE! Your help will be much appreciated!

## Introduction 
In this page, you will find all information on how to start contributing to FlyCAGE. In general, we have 5 main contributor profiles:
* Front-end developers
* Back-end developers
* Bioinformaticians
* Biostatisticians
* Biologists

If you don't fit the previous contributor profiles, no worries! There are many ways to contribute to FlyCAGE. Contact the project lead, Basheer Becerra, via email (bbecer2 (at) ilstu.edu) to get started.

__IMPORTANT__: FlyCAGE contributors must adhere by the [Contributor Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) code of conduct

## Workstation Setup
The first step is to setup your workstation depending on your contributor profile. See the [Workstation Setup Guide](WORKSTATION_SETUP.md) for instructions. 

## Choose a Task
We organize all tasks in GitHub's issue tracker. You can see a list of the tasks in the [Issue tab](https://github.com/CodingBash/FlyCAGE/issues). It is highly recommended to view the issues from the [Zenhub tab](https://github.com/CodingBash/FlyCAGE/issues#boards?repos=82305937) for better visualization.

In the ZenHub tab, scroll through the "Backlog" pipeline to see all tasks that are planned to be worked on. Each issue should have a tag indicating the recommended contributor profile such as "biostatisticians", "front-end development", etc. Choose a task that you are interested in, notify the project lead, mark yourself as the "Assignee" of the task, then move the task to the "In Progress" pipeline. 



That's it! Make sure to update the status of the task and stay in communication with the project lead!
