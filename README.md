> __Retrieving biological insights by comparing gene mRNA expression profiles.__

FlyCAGE is a tool that measures the correlation between gene expression profiles to retrieve insights. 

Visit [flycage.herokuapp.com](flycage.herokuapp.com) to try out our tool.


## Tool Description
### Problem
Unraveling complex genetic networks is important for understanding the mechanisms underlying organismal biology and disease. The emergence of high-throughput genomics provides the opportunity to utilize “big-data” in biology to gain insight into the structure of these networks. However, relative to the amount of biological data available, there is a lack of bioinformatics tools that leverage these data sets to formulate testable hypotheses. 

### Solution
CAGE is a web-accessible application that conducts integrative analysis of *Drosophila melanogaster* mRNA expression data to discover genes with correlated spatiotemporal expression. We would predict that genes showing this correlation may be co-regulated or share similar biological functions. CAGE therefore allows us to identify candidate genes involved in a given process, to discover regulatory interactions in genetic networks, and to verify the quality of gene clustering techniques.

### Value
Due to its cost-effectiveness, many genetics labs will retrieve the gene expression profiles to understand more about the underlying expirement. This retrieval is done through RNA-seq or microarrays. There are many easy ways to analyze gene expression data such as differential gene expression analysis, hierarchical clustering, gene set enrichment analysis. We hope that FlyCAGE will be another tool that scientists will use to easily retrive insights about their experimental data.

## Contribution
### What do we need?
Any sort of help on the project would be much appreciated!

Specifically, we are looking for front-end and back-end developers (no biology knowledge required), bioinformaticians with a strong knowledge of transcriptomics to help with data analysis and ideation, and biologists in any discipline of life sciences that may help with ideation.

## Development Setup
More information on the workstation setup will be added at a later time.
